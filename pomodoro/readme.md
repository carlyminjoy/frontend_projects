# Pomodoro Timer

The pomodoro technique uses a timer to break down work into intervals, generally 25 minutes in length,
seperated by short breaks of 5 minutes or so. 

This app is a straight-forward version of a pomodoro timer, where a user can adjust the work and break times and 
be alerted by a bell sound when the timer is up.

The app utilises:

- HTML5
- CSS3
- Responsive design
- JavaScript
- jQuery

Due to the learning purposes of this, all code was designed and written by me.
