Front-end projects

Most projects in this folder have been suggested projects from a curriculum such as FreeCodeCamp.
They have been used as a means to learn and solidify front end technologies and concepts, including:

- HTML5
- CSS3 & Flexbox
- BootStrap 4
- Responsive Design
- Sass
- JavaScript
- jQuery
- JSON, AJAX and APIs
- Object-oriented Design

Due to the learning purposes of these projects, all code was designed and written by me.
